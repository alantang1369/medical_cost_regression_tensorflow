# medical_cost_regression_tensorflow

We're going to try predict the cost of medical insurance for individuals based on a number of different parameters such as, `age`, `sex`, `bmi`, `children`, `smoking_status` and `residential_region`.

To do, we'll leverage the pubically available [Medical Cost dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) available from Kaggle and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv).
